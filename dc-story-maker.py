In a future world of 2046, a fat mouse named Findley is determined to find the ultimate supply of cheese. After a long and arduous journey, he finds what he's been seeking - a home in the living room of the lazy cat, Bumbles. As Findley explores his newfound haven, he quickly discovers that the cat isn't too fond of the idea of having a fat mouse in her home. A series of comedic and heartwarming encounters ensues as Findley attempts to outwit Bumbles and find a way to peacefully live together in the living room. Through their adventures, Findley and Bumbles learn to set aside their differences and become unlikely friends. In the end, the two are able to find a middle ground, allowing Findley and his family to stay in peace and feast on the endless supply of cheese.
